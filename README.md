# UDS
Unified Diagnostic Service (UDS) according to the ISO 14229 standard is a protocol used by diagnostic systems to communicate with ECUs in vehicles. The protocol is used to diagnose errors and reprogram ECUs. For example, it is possible to read and delete the fault memory of an ECU or to flash a new firmware on the ECU.
